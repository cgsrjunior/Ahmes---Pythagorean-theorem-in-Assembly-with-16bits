# Ahmes---Pythagorean-theorem-in-Assembly-with-16bits
The following program check if this sides of a triangle (in 16bits) satisfies the Pythagoeran Theorem or not. This code it's a form to calculate the the power of 2 in 16bits that generate a product of 32bits in a computer processor that use registers of 8bit
# Short explanation about Ahmes
Ahmes its a 8bit processor simulator based on a family of Motorola processor PDP-8 and architeture of Von Neumann with one addressing technique
# What You Need To Edit And Run this program
1. You need a assembler tool and a Ahmes simulator processor. You can find these tools here: http://www.inf.ufrgs.br/arq/wiki/doku.php?id=ahmes
2. Load the source code (.ahd file) on Daedalus to edit and set the values to the program on the variables: msb_a, lsb_a, msb_b, lsb_b, msb_c and lsb_c
2.1 Msb: Most significant bits; Lsb: Less significant bits. These info will be treat in binarie but you have to input then in decimal format
3. Press Ctrl+M after edit the info to assembler the program to a .mem format
4. Open the Ahmes simulator and press F3 to load the .mem file
5. Run the program with F9 or debug then step-bys-step with F8

I hope that you have fun :)
