# Ahmes---Pythagorean-theorem-in-Assembly-with-16bits
The following program check if this sides of a triangle (in 16bits) satisfies the Pythagoeran Theorem or not. This code it's a form to calculate the the power of 2 in 16bits that generate a product of 32bits in a computer processor that use registers of 8bit
